    <h1>Rise of 3D Printing in our School</h1>

    <h2>3D printing is a booming proccess of ingenuity</h2>
    <p>3D printing enables people like you and me to easily manufacture complex objects from the comfort of our own homes. Unlike the behemoth machines installed in factories, modern desktop 3D printers are small (they’re “desktop” for a reason), cheap (you can get the cheapest ones for $100; less than the cost of a smartphone), and easy enough to install to operate.</p>

        <p>It is often cheaper, faster and more customizable to 3D print something in your home than to buy such sundy items from the store. The technology is already quite mature and the build quality of the fabricated items is constantly improving. It’s not hard to imagine the oft-cited vision of a world where everyone has a 3D printer in their homes. That may never happen, but it is an utterly achievable thing for your home, should you choose.</p>
